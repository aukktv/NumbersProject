Part One - Programming

Using programming language of your choice, create a simple CONSOLE application which would allow the user to insert an unspecified amount of numbers (integers). One or several at a time - it's up to you.
●	Numbers should be stored in some collection/data structure.
●	Upon sending a "0" number, the application should stop accepting new values and must print the sum of all numbers divided by a number of today's day (E.g. Monday - 1, Thursday - 4, Friday - 5, etc.).
●	Try to handle invalid characters, symbols, and various errors.
Bonus: 
●	Create a simple console menu for further tasks:
○	Create a class that would print size (count) of your collection/data structure.
○	Create a class that would print all the numbers (not sum!) from your collection/data structure.
●	Demonstrate usage of object-oriented programming principles and best practices.

Part  Two - Documentation

Write documentation for your console application.
●	As a QA Engineer, you should be able to write a really short, detailed and easy-to-read documentation for non-technical people on how to setup and run your console application.
